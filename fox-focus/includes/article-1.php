                    <p><strong>Across the workforce and in educational institutions, refinement is seemingly inevitable as people encounter new experiences that challenge their current systems and beliefs.</strong><p>
                        <p>Naturally, many students, faculty and alumni at the Fox School have refined their approach to their professional and educational careers. Here are three examples of Owls who've made adjustments to alter the trajectory of their future.</p>

                <div class="article-1__content-image"><img src="https://www2.fox.temple.edu/fox-focus/assets/img/Derek-DJ-Fisher.jpg" class="imgslideblur-off"><p>Photo provided by Derek Fisher</div>
                    <div class="article-1__content-text-blue">    
                        <p class="article-1__content-intro">Growing up in the suburbs of Philadelphia, second year undergraduate student and Fox School student ambassador Derek "DJ" Fisher was confident early on he'd go to Temple.</p>
                        <p>"In middle school, I knew where I was going," says Fisher. "The Fox School of Business was the cherry on top. People talked about how it was a great business school and I saw the connections my neighbor had made going there."</p>
                        <p>While Fisher felt sure of his decision to go to the Fox School, his confidence in his intended major was uncertain.</p>
                        <p>Fisher says he mostly took general education courses during his first year of college to focus on getting acclimated to college life. His second semester, though, he took a major-specific course that changed the trajectory of his education at Temple.</p>
                        <p>"It was a good class, but I was just sitting there thinking, 'I don't know if this is for me,'" explains Fisher.</p>
                        <p>And so, Fisher decided to change his major to something that excited him more: marketing.</p> 

                        <div class="article-1__content-quote article-1__content-quote-open-white">IF YOU DON'T LIKE SOMETHING, JUST CHANGE IT."</div> 

                        <p>His decision came, in part, due to his experience as a student ambassador at the Fox School. In this role, Fisher says he was able to speak with students and faculty across all departments to learn about the different undergraduate programs available to him.</p>
                        <p>Fisher says marketing stood out to him the most. Plus, after learning that the School of Sport, Tourism and Hospitality Management offered a sport management certificate program, Fisher realized he could combine his curiosity for marketing with his lifelong passion for sports in a way he'd never imagined.</p>
                        <p>As Fisher begins his journey with marketing and sport management, he advises students: "If you don't like something, just change it."</p>

                        <p>With more than 20 years of experience working internationally at three of the largest global information technology providers, Assistant Professor of Management Information Systems (MIS) Marie-Christine Martin's career has been a process of continual refinement and learning—even after her transition from the corporate world to the academic world in 2015.</p> 
                        <p>As a professor, Martin finds opportunities to refine her teachings in order to meet modern industry demands. Just recently, she received an Experiential Learning award for her course redesign of Lead Global Projects (MIS 3535) to include a semester-long, live, client-facing project—a long and rewarding experience.</p>
                        <p>Martin's first redesign step? Taking the class herself.</p>
                        <p>Then, she began to redesign with the help of another faculty member</p> 

                        <div class="article-1__content-quote article-1__content-quote-close-blue">"MANY OF THE STUDENTS THAT HAVE TAKEN THE REDESIGNED COURSE HAVE SENT US FEEDBACK SAYING THEY USE IT EVERY DAY.</div> 

                        <p>"After I took the class to refresh and deep dive into [scrum] methodology, we looked into what we should keep, and what we should let go," explains Martin. "It was really us tag teaming."</p>
                        <p>For two semesters, Martin kept some of the course's previous content and then updated around 60% of the course material.</p>
                        <p>Martin says at the end of the year, she evaluated the material again to see where it could be updated to meet the needs of students and the industry, as well as to establish better more cohesive linkages with other MIS courses.</p>
                        <p>After three semesters to stabilize the updated curriculum, Martin's end result empowers students to use the concepts taught in class to build a website and other digital assets for a real industry client, preparing them for the workforce.</p>
                        <p>Martin says, "Many of the students that have taken the redesigned course have sent us feedback saying they use it every day. One student even had an internship during my class, and they said to me, 'Professor Martin, I actually used this today.'"</p>

            <div class="article-1__content-title">CHRISTOPHER GREY</div>
                <div class="article-1__content-image"><img src="https://www2.fox.temple.edu/fox-focus/assets/img/Christopher-Grey.jpg" class="imgslideblur-off"><p>Photo provided by Christopher Grey</p></div>
                    <div class="article-1__content-text-blue">    
                        <p>Unsure of what to do for work after graduating with his bachelor's degree, Christopher Grey, <em>MBA '20</em>, moved back to the Greater Philadelphia area and started loading boxes at UPS. Although he initially had no long-term plans to stay with the company, he quickly realized he could put his degree to work within its business development sector.</p>
                        <p>For the next 16 years, Grey worked his way up in the company. Then, he competed for two different positions within the company against two other employees—and found himself the only person without an offer.</p>
                        <p>Taken aback by this, Grey decided to start researching his graduate school options.</p> 
                        <p>"At first, I was angry. Then I realized I can't change (the company)—I can only change me," says Grey.</p>
                        
                        <div class="article-1__content-quote article-1__content-quote-close-white">"I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT MY TEMPLE DEGREE BECAUSE I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE SKILL SET.</div>

                        <p>Impressed by the Fox School's reputation, in-person classes and networking opportunities, Grey applied and was accepted into the Fox MBA program. Grey continued to work at UPS fulltime while pursuing his MBA and saw the benefit of his higher education experience in the workplace.</p>
                        <p>"I was promoted twice within those four years while at UPS," says Grey. "I attribute that to how my perspectives were broadened and how my knowledge of different business units grew exponentially. I took all those lessons and applied them to my day-to-day work activities and it just made me better."</p>
                        <p>But, Grey's career at UPS wasn't his long-term goal. Shortly before his 20-year work anniversary with UPS, he took the biggest risk of his career—accepting a buyout, effectively retiring from the only company he'd worked for.</p>
                        <p>"Leaving my 19-year career that I could've stayed at forever was a big risk. If I didn't have the MBA, I probably wouldn't have felt as confident taking the buyout," says Grey.</p> 

                        <div class="article-1__content-quote article-1__content-quote-open-white">AT FIRST, I WAS ANGRY. THEN I REALIZED I CAN'T CHANGE (THE COMPANY)—I CAN ONLY CHANGE ME."</div> 

                        <p>Months after leaving UPS, Grey began utilizing his alma mater's resources with the help of Pam Lyman, director of alumni career and professional development at the Fox School. He set up informational interviews with professionals he had connected with on LinkedIn and at Temple and was able to narrow down where he wanted to go with his career.</p>
                        <p>During this time, Grey received a message on LinkedIn about an opportunity at SmartKargo, software as a service firm that provides advanced integrated technology for the global air cargo industry.</p>
                        <p>One Zoom call and a trip to Boston later, Grey officially left behind the Fortune 500 world to blaze a new trail for a smaller software startup as its vice president of business development. It was a vastly different, but rewarding experience for him.<p> 
                        <p>"I couldn't have done it without Career and Professional Services. And, hands down, I couldn't have done it without my Temple degree because I wouldn't have had the skill set," says Grey.</p>
