            <p>Hodge, <em>LAW '74, '79</em>, and Roseman, <em>STH '02</em>, <em>MS '18</em>, have seen the campus change from various of perspectives. For Hodge, it was first as a student, then an educator, then a parent. He enrolled in Temple Law School in 1971 and has been a pillar in the Temple University community ever since. He's taught at the Fox School, the Lewis Katz School of Medicine and the Beasley School of Law. At Temple, he led one of the first large classroom lectures and served as chair of the Department of Legal Studies for 25 years. Hodge's daughter Lori and son both attended Temple, receiving two degrees each.</p>

            <p>Roseman has been a student, staff member, educator and possibly a parent at Temple, as her children are expected to attend the university. When she first graduated from the School of Sport, Tourism and Hospitality Management, she did not expect to return as a staff member. "My background was in event planning and never in a million years did I see myself going and then sticking with higher education," she says. Now celebrating 15 years with the Fox School, it seems to be the perfect fit. "I have a true passion for working in the Honors program," she adds.</p>
            
            <p>Together, Hodge and Roseman have a combined total of 76 years at Temple University. Here's what they said has changed the most.</p>

        <p>The experience of living on campus has evolved.</p>
        <p>"When I was a student, Temple was very much a commuter school," Roseman recalls. "There were very few dorms to choose from and nobody was living in off-campus housing as a freshman. Now it's a completely different type of school, to the point where everybody wants to live on campus."</p>

            <p>Hodge credits former Temple University President Peter J. Liacouras for his focus on creating an oncampus community.</p>
            <p>The shift in the environment on campus is evident by the ways communication has evolved. Before social media and texting, Roseman shared how students gathered together and spread the word about what was happening on campus.</p>
            <p>"There were these huge columns on campus and people used to staple event flyers and that's how you knew about events. We didn't have cell phones. We just used to knock on people's doors and say, â€˜Do you want to hang out?' That worked for us."</p>

            <p>Roseman adds that the diversification of majors and departments is due to the Fox School's commitment to its four Strategic Plan pillars, including Education Innovation.</p>
            <p>"Fox evolves with modern trends," she says.</p> 
            <p>Inside the classroom also looks increasingly different. Instructors now use smart boards instead of slide projectors. Recently, students in graduate courses have embraced virtual reality (VR), taking classes via Oculus VR headsets.</p>

            <p>"Today, we have smart classrooms and it's amazing how we've advanced from a technological point of view," Hodge adds.</p>
            <p>Roseman echoes her father's excitement. "I never imagined any scenario in higher education where you would be able to do everything virtually." </p>
            <p>That virtual expansion increased throughout the pandemic. "Education is going to be changed forever," Hodge elaborates. "There's always going to be a demand for online courses."</p>

    <p>Both Hodge and Roseman have seen firsthand how Temple students have changed and evolved.</p> 
    <p>"I've witnessed the transformation to such a diverse population of students from around the world," says Hodge.</p> 
    <p>Students are not just growing in diversity, but also in their desire for a well-rounded higher education experience.</p> 
    <p>"The students are different today. They won't just accept what I say. They'll challenge you on something, whereas before if the teacher said it, that was gospel," says Hodge.</p> 
    <p>Roseman agrees, "I believe that the hunger and the drive have always been there, but now students are more focused on leadership positions and experiential learning opportunities early. More students want to study abroad, not just for a summer, but for a semester or even for an entire year."</p>
    <p>"Diversity, inclusion and social responsibility are much more important to students now and they really are showing greater emotional and cultural intelligence," Roseman adds. Temple has also made a significant stride in available resources for the community on campus.</p>
    <p>"The university has made a much more conscious effort to support the students and staff at the school and university as a wholeâ€”with medical, psychological, emotional and financial help," Hodge says.</p>

        </div>   
                <p>"I truly believe that both of my degrees have helped prepare me for who I am today," Roseman shares. "Over the years, I've developed a lot more confidence. I've expanded my network. I'm a true student leader, an advocate and have built very strong and lasting relationships with my students. 
                    <p>"Another thing that I've learned is that empathy is everything because you really never truly know what someone is going through. Always be supportive, compassionate and ready to listen." 
                    <p>This year, Hodge celebrates his 47th year of teaching. "It dawned on me how long I have been at Temple when a student came up to me and said, â€˜My mom said to say hi," he says, laughing. "I have gone through generations of students at Temple." 
                    <p>Hodge will be transitioning to retirement over the next few years. However, he is proud of his accomplishments and the work he has pioneered during his time at Temple. 
                    <p>Roseman adds, "I believe that Temple is on a path to continuously improving campus. I see Temple aiming to be a very vibrant campus amongst its competitors that are maybe not in an urban environment. I don't ever see it going backward. I only see it continuing to move forward."</p>

            <p><strong>JON HUYNH, <em>BBA '16</em></strong>, was a Fox Honors student and credits Roseman for guiding him. "She definitely helped me figure out what I wanted to do. She did a lot of my advising and because of her, I ended up working as a student advisor," he says.</p>
            <p>As both Roseman and Huynh discussed their time as students, it was clear there were differences. One of the first points of conversation: the food.</p>
            <p>Roseman recalls only a handful of spots students could eat and socialize besides the Johnson and Hardwick cafeteria and dorms. "There was one pizza place called Owl's Nest and we would hang out at Salad Alley, where Maxi's is now located."</p>
            <p>Students today can now enjoy a variety of selections, from food trucks to fast food restaurants in the student center. It is also something that students miss when they graduate.</p>
            <p>"I didn't realize it until I moved away for my first job, but food trucks and having such a vibrant food scene is not common everywhere you go," Huynh shares.</p> 
            <p>During Roseman's time as a student, the most popular majors were nursing, communication and education. On the contrary, in 2016, Huynh's peers were interested in management information systems, actuarial science and risk management. Huynh himself was part of the first graduating class for the statistical science and data analytics program.</p> 
            <p>"I thought there was one path to do everything, but the Fox School and Temple opened up my eyes to see that not every job, career, or whatever you want to do, has just one way to get there," he says. "It was through opportunities like the BYOBB [the Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship's Be Your Own Boss BowlÂ®] that I started to understand that there are all sorts of tools here for students interested in starting their own thing. Joining that competition helped me understand that everything doesn't have to be unilateral," Huynh says. </p>
            <p>The BYOBB is a pitch competition for aspiring entrepreneurs, open to all students, alumni, faculty and staff from all 17 schools and colleges within Temple. Huynh participated in 2019 and won the "Crowd Favorite" award. </p>
            <p>Now, Huynh is pursuing a graduate degree in data science at Columbia University while working as a software engineer for mobile iOS development at All Your Cards In One. It is a startup mobile app that combines your cards so that each transaction routes to the best credit card in your wallet when you pay. </p>
            <p>"I think I became a professional," Huynh says, considering his time at the Fox School. "Coming in, I had no idea what it meant to be ready for job fairs, career fairs and interviews or how to work in teams and in the workplace. The school helped prepare me for all those things at a professional level."</p>
